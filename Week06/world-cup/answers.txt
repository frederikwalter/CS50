Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

For small number of simulations the chance of winning for Italy and China in the womans set is changing.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stablized after about 400000 simulations.
